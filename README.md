# ENERGIS_WebGIS
## Description

This application consists of:  
  
1/ A website for a fictional consulting firm specializing in geomatics applied to renewable energies.  
2/ A WebGIS application that allows users to visualize all wind and photovoltaic projects implemented in metropolitan France.  

## Features  

### 1) Website  

The website will consist of several pages allowing users to:    
  
- Present geomatics to renewable energy professionals who are not familiar with this discipline.    
- Describe the services offered by the consulting firm in terms of geospatial analysis applied to renewable energies.      
- Detail the features and data available through the mapping application.    
- Provide a registration and login space to access the application.     

### 2) WebGIS Application  

All application features will be integrated with the mapping interface to leverage geospatial data and manage user accounts.  
  
#### A. <ins>Users</ins>  

Access to the WebGIS platform will require authentication via a username (email address) and password provided during registration. Users will be able to freely log out of the application and manage their personal information through a user profile.  
  
Information collected during registration via a sign-up form:    
- Last name  
- First name  
- Email address  
- Postal address  
- Postal code  
- City  
- Phone number  
- Password  
  
All this information can be updated by the user through their personal space.  

Mapping features accessible to users:    
- Read-only consultation of cartographic data by simple click in the application.    
- Export of maps to PDF format.   
- Use of calculation tools and distance/area measurement.    
- Access to a personal data layer dedicated to users for drawing their own project areas (wind or solar).    
- Quick locality search via a search field: users can enter an address and the application will automatically zoom to the location found using a geocoding tool from the Leaflet library (using an OpenStreetMap API).    
   
Through a dashboard, the user can access their profile as well as all the study areas they have drawn in the mapping application. They can view, modify, and delete them.    


#### B. <ins>Administrators</ins>  

The administrator will have a dedicated interface (dashboard) for managing users and the application's geographic data:    

- Create new user accounts.   
- Delete client accounts upon cancellation request.    
- Access user information (last name, first name, phone number, email address, postal address) without being able to modify it.   
- Manage roles and permissions (standard user, administrator).  
- Add, delete, and modify geographic data information and geometries.  
  

## Technologies Used  
SCSS, JavaScript, Leaflet, React, Node.js, MySQL

## Local Installation  
1/ Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/FB-GIS/ENERGIS_WebGIS.git  
2/ Create your MySQL database with the SQL files corresponding to the tables (see MCD/MLD in *backend* folder) contained in the *backend/data* folder.    
3/ Modify the information in the .env_example file with your database details (host, user, password, secret code, etc.) and rename it to .env   
4/ In your IDE terminal, navigate to the backend folder: *cd sites/0_ENERGIS/backend/* on Windows THEN *npm run dev*  
5/ In a second IDE terminal, navigate to the frontend folder: *cd sites/0_ENERGIS/backend/* on Windows THEN *npm run dev*    
6/ For SCSS management, navigate to the css folder: *cd sites/0_ENERGIS/frontend/src/css/* THEN *sass --watch style.scss:style.css*  

## Data Sources  
Data specific to wind and photovoltaic projects was aggregated from multiple public sources (DREAL, DDT, Geo-IDE, etc.)
